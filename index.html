      <p>A Denver-based software development manager leading a team of world-class engineers for a global enterprise software company.
      </p>
      <p>I tend to think the title 'servant leader' is a bit cliched, but I think that approach is the only way to be truly successful as a leader (or manager) of people.
            I believe that happy developers are those who can go home everyday feeling good about what they accomplished that day. My approach to management starts with
            expectations and shared values. While they seem to always be evolving, the current values I bring to my team are as follows:
            <ul>
              <li>team success over individual success</li>
              <li>delivering products is better than writing code</li>
              <li>respect our work and non-work humanity</li>
              <li>fun is good - satisfaction is better</li>
              <li>process should serve the team and org - not the other way around</li>
              <li>be the solution</li>
            </ul>
      </p>
      <p>I also still write some code from time to time - primarily focused on tasks that will help accelerate my team. My experience as a developer is wide in breadth.
        I've been referred to as a polyglot, but I tend to first approach problems outside the context of a language.
        Much of my experience is as full-stack web developer, but the last 10 years I have focused much more on the front end of web stack.
        JavaScript development is a moving target, so I try to be picky about which moves I follow and which aren't worth the effort.
        Overall, I still prefer the parts of the software that interact with a user.
      </p>

      <p>Check out my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m937xlfl2ZLgY7X1l1iRoGaoy1YtuQx1gIiHAWj6S1I/edit?usp=sharing">Resume</a>. My <a href="https://github.com/troyef">github</a> may also have some interesting stuff. (Though I'm not making any promises on that one.)
